# rivr
what
==
rivr is a micro framework for data-driven websites. Leveraging the structure of incoming JSON data, rivr performs simple tasks easily, such as updating data-fields and performing data-loops of unknown length. Despite its simple function, adding custom rules and actions enable developers to build powerful and customized designs without complexity. 
why
==
rivr was built as an alternative to angular, ember, backbone, and react; sometimes you just want something super simple.

GPLv3.0 -- as rivr is a young and ever developing micro framework, it is very important that improvements to the framework be shared with the community; so share. Plus, we'd love to see what you are using rivr.js for!
