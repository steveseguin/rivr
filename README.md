# rivr
rivr is a micro framework for data-driven websites. Leveraging the structure of incoming JSON data, rivr performs simple tasks easily, such as updating data-fields and performing data-loops of unknown length. Despite its simple function, adding custom rules and actions enable developers to build powerful and customized designs without complexity. 

A simple demo of rivr in action can be found here:
